# Admin Users Events Feature - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview
Added functionality to display events that users have joined in the admin users management page at `/admin/users`.

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. UserController.php
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`

**Changes**:
- Updated `index()` method to load event participants with their events
- Added eager loading for `eventParticipants.event` relationship
- Filtered events to only show those created by the current organizer
- Changed view name from `admin.users.index` to `admin.users`

**Key Code**:
```php
$users = $query->with(['eventParticipants.event' => function($query) use ($eventIds) {
    $query->whereIn('id', $eventIds);
}])->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->paginate(10);
```

### 2. admin/users.blade.php
**File**: `resources/views/admin/users.blade.php`

**Changes**:
- Updated table header from "Events" to "Events & Participation"
- Enhanced the Events column to show:
  - Count of events created by user
  - Count of events joined by user
  - List of first 3 events joined with status badges
  - Expandable detailed view for all events
- Added expandable rows for detailed event information
- Added JavaScript toggle functionality
- Added action button to view/hide events

**New Features**:

   - Event title and status
   - Event date and time
   - Event location
   - Event category
   - Payment information
   - Attendance status
3. **Interactive Toggle**: Click button to expand/collapse event details

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

## 📊 Data Displayed

### For Each User:
1. **Basic Info**: Name, email, type, join date
2. **Event Counts**: 
   - Events created (if organizer)
   - Events joined (as participant)
3. **Event Details** (when expanded):
   - Event title
   - Event date and time

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Relationships:
- Uses existing `eventParticipants` relationship in User model
- Filters events to only show those created by current organizer

### Performance Optimizations:
- Eager loading prevents N+1 query problems
- Pagination limits data load
- JavaScript toggle reduces initial page load

### Error Handling:
- Handles deleted events gracefully
- Shows appropriate messages for users with no events
- Validates event existence before displaying details
